### Time conversion tool for agents

This is meant to be a straightforward way for agents in Zendesk to convert times within the ticket interface:

#### Currently available:

* Generate a date from X amount of days out from current day (locally to agent's time zone)
* Generate current epoch time

#### Future features
* Timezone-to-Timezone conversion

More to come...
